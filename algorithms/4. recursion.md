# Recursion

https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/recursion/

## Definition
Recursion is method of solving computational problem where solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of same problem.

## Characteristics
- Contains two parts:
    1. Base case defined, which defines when recursion is stopped.
    2. Breaking down problem into smaller subproblems and invoking recursive call.
- e.g. Fibonacci Sequence
```python
    def fib(n):
        if n<= 1:
            return n
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

## Review
1. Always remember to define base case.
2. Useful for permutation because it generates all combinations and tree-based questions. Know how to generate all permutations of a sequence as well as handling duplicates.
3. Implicitly uses a stack. Hence all recursive approaches can be rewritten iteratively using stack. Beware of cases where recursion level is too deep and causes stack overflow. Will never of `O(1)` space because stack.

## Corner Cases
- `n = 0`
- `n = 1`
- Make sure we have enough base cases to cover all possible invocations of the recursive function

## Techniques
- Memoization
    - `fib(5)` calls `fib(4)` and `fib(3)`, and `fib(4)` calls `fib(3)` and `fib(2)`. `fib(3)` is being called twice! If the value for `fib(3)` is memoized and used again, that greatly improves the efficiency of the algorithm and the time complexity becomes `O(n)`.
