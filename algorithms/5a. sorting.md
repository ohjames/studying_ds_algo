# Sorting

## Types of Sorts and Definitions

### 1. Selection Sort
Selection sort iterates through a list of elements, finding the smallest one, and putting it aside into a sorted list. While we iterate through unsorted and keep appending to sorted list.

#### Psuedocode
1. Set smallest number/minimum to first element in array.
2. Look for smallest number/minimum element in list.
3. Swap value with item at index[min].
4. Increment index of [min] to next element.
5. Repeat until last element/list is sorted.

#### Implementation
```python
def selection_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    
    for i in range(n):
        # Find the minimum element in the remaining unsorted array
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
                min_idx = j
        
        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element
        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]
    
    return arr
```

#### Time Complexity
- Time: `O(n^2^)`

### 2. Bubble Sort
Bubble sort iterates through the list/array that is given, and compares each pair of adjacent elements in list by size. If elements are in incorrect order, swap, and move onto next pair (large number bubbles to end of list first).

#### Pseudocode
1. Set swapped to true
2. While swapped is true
    - Set swapped to false
    - Iterate through the list from index 0 to n-1
        - If the current element is greater than the next element
            - Swap the current element with the next element
            - Set swapped to true
3. Return the sorted list

#### Implementation
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    
    return arr
```

#### Time Complexity
- Time: `O(n^2^)`

### 3. Insertion Sort
