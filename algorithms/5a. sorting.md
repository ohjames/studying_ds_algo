# Sorting

## Types of Sorts and Definitions

### 1. Selection Sort
Sorts through a list of items by iterating through a list of elements, finding the smallest one, and putting it aside into a sorted list. While we iterate through unsorted and keep appending to sorted list.

#### Psuedocode
1. Set smallest number/minimum to first element in array.
2. Look for smallest number/minimum element in list.
3. Swap value with item at index[min].
4. Increment index of [min] to next element.
5. Repeat until last element/list is sorted.

#### Implementation
```python
def selection_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    
    for i in range(n):
        # Find the minimum element in the remaining unsorted array
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
                min_idx = j
        
        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element
        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]
    
    return arr
```

#### Time Complexity
- Time: `O(n^2^)`
