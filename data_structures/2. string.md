# Strings

## Definition
Strings are sequence of characters.

## Characteristics
- Trie/Prefix Tree and Suffix Tree are common data structures for looking up strings.
- `Rabin Karp` is common string algorithm for efficiently searching of substring using rolling hash
- `KMP` is another common string algorithm for efficient searching of substring.

## Time Complexities
| Operation | Big-O     |
| :--------: | :-------: |
| Access | O(1) |
| Search | O(n) |
| Insert | O(n) |
| Remove | O(n) |

Operations involving another string and assuming other string is length m:
| Operation | Big-O     | Note      |
| :--------: | :-------: | :-------: |
| Find substring | O(n*m) | Most naive case. KMP algorithm is more efficient for string searching. |
| Concatenating strings | O(n+m) | |
| Slice | O(m) | |
| Split (by token) | O(n+m) | |
| Strip (remove leading and trailing whitespaces) | O(n) | |

## Review
1. Ask about input character set and case sensitivity. USually the characters are limited to lowercase characters.

## Corner Cases
- Empty string
- String with 1 or 2 characters
- String with repeated characters
- Strings with only distinct characters

## Techniques
- [ ] Counting characters
- [ ] String of unique characters
- [ ] Anagram
- [ ] Palindrome
