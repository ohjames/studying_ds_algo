# Graph

https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/graph/

## Definition
Graph contains set of objects (nodes or vertices) where there can be edges between these nodes/vertices. Edges can be directed or undirected and can optionally have values (weighted graph).

## Characteristics
- Commonly used to model relationship between unordered entities such as:
    - Friendship between people -- each node is person and edges between nodes represent two people are friends.
    - Distance between locations -- each node is location and edge between nodes represent two locations are connected. Value of edge represents distance.

## Time Complexity

| Topological sort | O(V + E) |

## Review
1. Tree-like diagram could be a graph that allows for cycles and a naive recursive solution won't work. Need to handle cycles and keep set of visited nodes when traversing.
2. Ensure keeping track of visited nodes correctly and not visiting each node more than once.

## Corner Cases
- Empty graph
- Graph with one or two nodes
- Disconnected graphs
- Graph with cycles

## Graph Search Algorithms
- Common: breadth-first search, depth-first search
- Uncommon: topological sort, Dijkstra's algorithm
- Almost never: Bellman-Ford algorithm, Floyd-Warshall algorithm, Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm

### Depth-first search
DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Stack usually used to keep track of nodes on current search path either by implicit recursion stack or actual stack.

#### Implementation
```python
def dfs(matrix):
  # Check for an empty matrix/graph.
  if not matrix:
    return []

  rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
  visited = set()
  directions = ((0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0))

  def traverse(i, j):
    if (i, j) in visited:
      return

    visited.add((i, j))
    # Traverse neighbors.
    for direction in directions:
      next_i, next_j = i + direction[0], j + direction[1]
      if 0 <= next_i < rows and 0 <= next_j < cols:
        # Add in question-specific checks, where relevant.
        traverse(next_i, next_j)

  for i in range(rows):
    for j in range(cols):
      traverse(i, j)
```
### Breadth-first search
BFS explores all nodes at present depth, before moving on to nodes at next depth level. Queue is usually used to keep track of nodes that were encounters but not yet explored.

#### Implementation
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(matrix):
  # Check for an empty matrix/graph.
  if not matrix:
    return []

  rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
  visited = set()
  directions = ((0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0))

  def traverse(i, j):
    queue = deque([(i, j)])
    while queue:
      curr_i, curr_j = queue.popleft()
      if (curr_i, curr_j) not in visited:
        visited.add((curr_i, curr_j))
        # Traverse neighbors.
        for direction in directions:
          next_i, next_j = curr_i + direction[0], curr_j + direction[1]
          if 0 <= next_i < rows and 0 <= next_j < cols:
            # Add in question-specific checks, where relevant.
            queue.append((next_i, next_j))

  for i in range(rows):
    for j in range(cols):
      traverse(i, j)
```

### Topological sorting
Topological sort/ordering of directed graph is linear ordering of its vertices such that every directed edge `uv` from vertex `u` to vertex `v`, `u` comes before `v` in ordering. Topological sort is graph traversal in which each node `v` is visited only after all its dependencies are visited.
- e.g. Most commonly used for scheduling sequence of jobs or tasks which has dependencies on other jobs/tasks. Jobs are represented by vertices, and edge from x to y if job x must be completed before job y can start.

#### Implementation
```python
def graph_topo_sort(num_nodes, edges):
    from collections import deque
    nodes, order, queue = {}, [], deque()
    for node_id in range(num_nodes):
        nodes[node_id] = { 'in': 0, 'out': set() }
    for node_id, pre_id in edges:
        nodes[node_id]['in'] += 1
        nodes[pre_id]['out'].add(node_id)
    for node_id in nodes.keys():
        if nodes[node_id]['in'] == 0:
            queue.append(node_id)
    while len(queue):
        node_id = queue.pop()
        for outgoing_id in nodes[node_id]['out']:
            nodes[outgoing_id]['in'] -= 1
            if nodes[outgoing_id]['in'] == 0:
                queue.append(outgoing_id)
        order.append(node_id)
    return order if len(order) == num_nodes else None

print(graph_topo_sort(4, [[0, 1], [0, 2], [2, 1], [3, 0]]))
# [1, 2, 0, 3]
```
