# Hash Tables

https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/hash-table/

## Definition
Hash table (commonly referred to as hash map) implements an associative array abstract data type mapping keys to values.

## Characteristics
- Hash table uses hash function on an element to compute an index, also called hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which desired value can be found. 
- During lookup, key is hashed and resulting hash indicates where corresponding value is stored.

## Advantages
- Determining if element is present is hashing element and seeing if it exists in hash table taking `O(1)` on average.

## Disadvantages
- May run into hash collisions.
    - Separate chaining - linked list is used for each value, so that it stores all collided items.
    - Open addressing - all entry records are stored in bucket array itself. When new entry has to be inserted, buckets are examined, starting with hashed-to-slot and proceeding in probe sequence, until unoccupied slot is found.

## Implementations
| Language | API |
| :--------: | :-------: |
| C++ | `std::unordered_map` |
| Java | `java.util.Map`. Use `java.util.HashMap` |
| Python | `dict` |
| JavaScript | `Object` or `Map` |

## Time Complexities
| Operation | Big-O     | Note      |
| :--------: | :-------: | :-------: |
| Access | N/A | Accessing not possible as hash code is not known |
| Search | O(1) | |
| Insert | O(1) | |
| Remove | O(1) | |
