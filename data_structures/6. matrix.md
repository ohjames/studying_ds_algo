# Matrix

https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/matrix/

## Definition
Matrix is 2d array.

## Characteristics
- Related to dynamic programming or graph traversal.
- Can be used to represent graphs where each node is cell on matrix which has 4 neighbors.

## Corner Cases
- Empty matrix. Check that none of arrays are 0 length.
- 1 x 1 matrix
- Matrix with only one row or column

## Techniques
- Creating an empty N x M matrix
    - Always make copy of matrix with same size/dimensions that is initialized to empty values to store visited state or dynamic programming table.
    - e.g. 
        ```python
        # Assumes that matrix is non-empty
        zero_matrix = [[0 for _ in range(len(matrix[0]))] for _ in range(len(matrix))]
        # Copying matrix
        copied_matrix = [row[:] for row in matrix]
        ```
- Transposing a matrix
    - Found by interchanging rows into columns or vice versa.
    - Example games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Sudoku, Crossword, Connect 4, Battleship, etc.
    - Verify matrix for horizontal cells, transpose matrix, and reuse logic for horizontal verification to verify originally vertical cells(which are now horizontal)
        - e.g.
            ```python
            transposed_matrix = zip(*matrix)
            ```
