## Definition
Tries are special trees (prefix trees) that make searching and storing strings efficient.

## Characteristics
- Practical applications such as conducting searches and providing autocomplete.

## Time Complexity
`m` is length of string used in operation.
| Operation | Big-O |
| :--------: | :-------: |
| Search | O(m) |
| Insert | O(m) |
| Remove | O(m) |

## Corner cases
- Searching for a string in an empty trie
- Inserting empty strings into a trie

## Techniques
- Preprocessing a dictionary of words (given a list) into trie, will improve efficiency of searching for word of length `k`, among `n` words.
    - Searching becomes O(k) instead of O(n).
