# Queue

https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/queue/

## Definition
Queue is linear collection of elements that are maintained in sequence and can be modified by addition of elements at one end of sequence (enqueue) and removal of elements from other end (dequeue).

## Characteristics
- End of sequence at which elements are added is called back, tail or rear of queue, and at end at which elements are removed is called head or front of queue.
- Aka abstract data type, can be implemented using array or singly linked lists.
- FIFO
- BFS is commonly implemented using queues.

## Implementations
| Language | API |
| :--------: | :-------: |
| C++ | `std::queue` |
| Java | `java.util.Queue` or `java.util.ArrayDeque` |
| Python | `queue` |
| JavaScript | N/A |

## Time Complexity
| Operation | Big-O |
| :--------: | :-------: |
| Enqueue/Offer | O(1) |
| Dequeue/Poll | O(1) |
| Front | O(1) |
| Back | O(1) |
| isEmpty | O(1) |

## Review
1. Most languages don't have built-in Queue class, so people use arrays (JS) or lists (Python) as queue.
    a. Dequeue operation in these cases will be `O(n)` because requires shifting all of other elements left by one.

## Corner cases
- Empty queue
- Queue with one item
- Queue with two items
