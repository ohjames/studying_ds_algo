# Heap

https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/heap/

## Definition
Heap is specialized tree-based data structure which is a complete tree satisfying heap property.
    - Max heap: value of node must be greatest among node values in its entire subtree. Same property must be recursively true for all nodes in the tree.
    - Min heap: value of node must be smallest among node values in its entire subtree. Same property must be recursively true for all nodes in the tree.

## Characteristic
- Heaps and priority queues can be treated as same data structure.
- Useful when necessary to repeatedly remove object with highest (or lowest) priority, or when insertions need to be interspersed with removals of root node.

## Implementations
| Language | API |
| :--------: | :-------: |
| C++ | `std::priority_queue` |
| Java | `java.util.PriorityQueue` |
| Python | `heapq` |
| JavaScript | N/A |

## Time Complexity
| Operation | Big-O |
| :--------: | :-------: |
| Find max/min | O(1) |
| Insert | O(log n) |
| Remove | O(log n) |
| Heapify (create a heap out of given array of elements) | O(n) |

## Techniques
- Mention of `k`
    - Top or lowest `k` usually means heap can be used.
    - Top `k` elements use min heap of size `k` by iterating through each element, pushing it into heap (in python `heapq`, invert value first). Whenever heap size exceeds `k`, remove minimum element.
